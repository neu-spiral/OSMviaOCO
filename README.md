The work explores efficient online algorithms for maximizing monotone submodular functions under general matroid constraints. Please cite this paper ([a preprint is available](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04339.pdf)) if you intend to use this code for your research.

**Datasets.** All datasets used in this work are located in the `datasets/` folder.
- $\texttt{ZKC}$
- $\texttt{Epinions}$
- $\texttt{MovieLens}$
- $\texttt{TeamFormation}$

Dataset $\texttt{SynthWC}$  is generated on the fly in simple_exps.py. 
**Algorithms.**  All algorithms are implemented in the `oco_tools.py` file.
Implemented algorithms:
- $\texttt{RAOCO - OGA}$
- $\texttt{RAOCO - OMA}$
- $\texttt{FSF}^*$
- $\texttt{TabularGreedy}$

**Examples.** 
Execute $\texttt{RAOCO-OGA}$ algorithm on the $\texttt{ZKC}$ dataset under partition matroid constraints, restricting selection to $k$ nodes per partition.

``` bash
python3 main.py --problemType ZKC --eta 1  --policy OGA --k 2  --partitions datasets/ZKC_100_01_42_partitions --input datasets/ZKC_100_01_42
```

Uniform matroid? Leave out the `--partitions` option.

**Logged Results.**  The results of our experiments are saved in the `results/` folder.

**Visualization.** The GeneratePlots.py script processes a populated results/ folder by: (1) generating plots, and (2) building tables with: (a) fractional optimal rewards, (b) normalized integral/fractional rewards, and (c) key algorithm parameters (e.g., $\eta$). We report rewards as average cumulative values at $t \in \{T/3,2T/3,T\}$ (time slots). For experiments with varying seeds (e.g., `python3 main.py * --seed 42`), both the mean and standard deviation of rewards are calculated.
